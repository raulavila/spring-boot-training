# Spring Boot training

We wrote this app to learn how to test drive a Spring Boot app. We started with a REST API, added web pages, and then security.

## Run the app

`./gradlew bootRun`

## Run the tests

- `./gradlew clean test` to run unit tests only
- `./gradlew clean integrationTest` to run integration tests only
- `./gradlew clean test integrationTest` to run all tests
